# Assigment: bAmazon

## Technologies Used:
- NPM: I used specifically the MySQL, Inquirer and CLI-Table node package managers throughout the entire assigment. MySQL to create the bamazon table database. Inquirer to create the user prompts within the command line terminal. And the CLI-Table npm to create clean tables of the bamazon product
